# ColorCombiner

This project was created as a basic programming exercise. ColorCombiner takes 2 user-selected colors and takes the mean red, green, and blue components of the colors, returning the average color of the two. This tool does not take into consideration color theory and simply finds the mathematical average of the two selected colors.
